Fully autonomouse vehicle
Jesse Levinson
-object tracking, motion blurness, real-time tracking
- use 6-DOF calibration 3D sensors to 2D cameras to track the hand gestures, and user movements

Bottlenecks:
- generating supervised data, feeding with enough data to sufficiently react to the multiple scenarios.
- training/testing the model
