- test and develop computer vision algorithms for autonomouos aerial vehicles, mostly in C++
- Use many SoC, stands for system on chip for embedded systems work. We used Odroid XU3, XU4, Xilinx FPGA board

When I was in college, being part of the computer vision team of the Penn State Unmanned 
Aerial Systems,my work is to develop and test the Computer Vision algorithms for aerial 
vehicle tasks, and collect test data from the flying unmanned vehicles(Phantom2, 3DR X8, 
and self-designed unmanned drones). These work are all done in C++ compiled under Linux, 
it incorporates the application software, device drivers, embeded software, server-to-client 
in a very efficient way. Although the C++ code might be much longer than Python, but we get 
more freedom to analyze and upgrade it from a low-level perspective.
