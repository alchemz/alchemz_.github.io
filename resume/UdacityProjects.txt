Udacity Projects:
1. Finding Lane Lines

My goal in this project was to successfully identify and label the lanes the car was driving on. Each frame of the video needed to be analyzed and returned with red lines over the lanes the vehicle was in.

This project was a bit challenging for me simply because I had to learn about Hough space and Canny edge detection. But I loved the challenge and experimenting with ways to improve it. Most of mine failed, or would fail outside of these test examples, but it was still fun to try them out.
2. Traffic Sign Classifier

3. Behavioral Cloning

5. Vehicel Detection Using YOLO

The goal of the project is to detect and draw squares around cars in dashcam footage. I used a YOLO image detection network to predict the boxes and labels that I put on the image. I choose to use a one-shot approach to this instead of the Udacity recommended approach for a few reasons:
I’ve heard models like this are more commonly used in the industry than the HOG/SVM style approach Udacity teaches

“YOLO” or “You Only Look Once” (hah ಠ_ಠ), is a massive Convolutional Neural network for object detection and classification. As a quote from its website explains “This network divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.”
