data mining:
why learn: very large databases, huge amount of scientific data have been generated 
Example topics include: linear classification/regression, logistic regression, model regularization, dimension reduction, prototype methods, decision trees, mixture models, and hidden Markov models.

deep learning:
Neural Networks Basics, Shalldow Neural Networks(Hidden Layer), Deep Neural Networks.

Computer Vision:
Collecting test data from the flying unmanned vehicles(Phantom2, 3DR X8, and self-designed. unmanned drones.

Speech Recognition:

Image Processing:
VRbal: Trained for using the open-source Speech Recognition package, which is the CMU Sphinx4.

Parallel Computing(GPU):

AR/VR:

Robotics Control:

HCI:

Udacity Self-Driving:
TensorFlow, Computer Vision Fundamentals, Convolutional Neural Networks, and etc, are the most â€‹fascinating things I have learned 
in the past months. 

Talking about experience in the automated driving field, I have been part of the Penn State Unmanned Aerial Systems, which is 
interdisciplinary student-focused group that aims to build, study, and design the next generation of unmanned aerial systems.

My responsibilities in the team are: 
working with scanning laser rangefinder to detect and locate obstacles as well as other drones;  
designing and training computer vision algorithms to accomplish efficient moving object detection.
